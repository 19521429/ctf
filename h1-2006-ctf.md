# The Competition Begins!
The tweet announces the CTF challenge. Looks like we will need to find a way to process some payments.

# Initial Exploring
Reading up on the extended description at https://hackerone.com/h1-ctf/ reveals that the target of this competition are the domains within `*.bountypay.h1ctf.com`. 

Scanning for available subdomains revealed:
- bountypay.h1ctf.com
- app.bountypay.h1ctf.com
- www.bountypay.h1ctf.com
- staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com
- api.bountypay.h1ctf.com
- software.bountypay.h1ctf.com

The description also mentioned that we should keep a look out on the HackerOne twitter for clues. I took another closer look through their feed.

Right away, this particular retween stood out:

Viewing their profile shows:

I wonder who they are following?

Sandra has a very interesting tweet!

Zoom, enhance! Her staff ID is clearly visible in this tweet. `STF:8FJ3KFISL3`. Thanks, Sandra, this should come in handy later. 

Scanning the barcode didn't really seem to reveal anything. Best to move on for now and to look at the sites.

# Beginning the Journey
First things first, https://bountypay.h1ctf.com/.
![img](images/main-site.PNG)

The main site is pretty uneventful, just a splash screen with two external login pages, and some tumbleweeds.

The customer login is hosted on https://app.bountypay.h1ctf.com/, and the staff login is on https://staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com/.

The login pages were sanitized against SQL injection, and there was no way to create a new account. 

Well, maybe we need to explore some more.

# Fuzz Faster U Fool
Time to do some directory bruteforcing to see if anything is available other than the login pages. Using the perfectly named `ffuf - Fuzz Faster U Fool`, I scanned for directories on the `app` domain.

```
css                     [Status: 301, Size: 194, Words: 7, Lines: 8]
images                  [Status: 301, Size: 194, Words: 7, Lines: 8]

.                       [Status: 301, Size: 194, Words: 7, Lines: 8]                  
.git                    [Status: 403, Size: 170, Words: 5, Lines: 7] 
cgit                    [Status: 403, Size: 170, Words: 5, Lines: 7]
```

That `.git` is very interesting. Trying to `GET` it returned a 403, but what about it's contents? 

I tried going to `/.git/config` in my browser, and it started downloading.

# Finding a Way In

Let's see what we are dealing with:
```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/bounty-pay-code/request-logger.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
```

The GitHub account has one repository with one file in it, `logger.php`.

```php
<?php

$data = array(
  'IP'        =>  $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"],
  'URI'       =>  $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"],
  'METHOD'    =>  $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"],
  'PARAMS'    =>  array(
      'GET'   =>  $_GET,
      'POST'  =>  $_POST
  )
);

file_put_contents('bp_web_trace.log', date("U").':'.base64_encode(json_encode($data))."\n",FILE_APPEND   );
```

Looks like they are logging their site activity to `bp_web_trace.log`. Let's see if we can grab that file off of `app`.

```

```

Decoding the base 64 entries shows:
```
{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/","METHOD":"GET","PARAMS":{"GET":[],"POST":[]}}
{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/","METHOD":"POST","PARAMS":{"GET":[],"POST":{"username":"brian.oliver","password":"V7h0inzX"}}}
{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/","METHOD":"POST","PARAMS":{"GET":[],"POST":{"username":"brian.oliver","password":"V7h0inzX","challenge_answer":"bD83Jk27dQ"}}}
{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/statements","METHOD":"GET","PARAMS":{"GET":{"month":"04","year":"2020"},"POST":[]}}
```

Great, we've got our username and password. Let's login to `app`.

# Trying the Door

Should be smooth sailing. Only it looks like they have one more security step.

![img](images/2fa.PNG)

Trying the code from the log didn't work, these codes are generated new every time.

Here, I used one of my favourite Burp Suite features, `Prominently highlight hidden fields`.

![img](images/2fa-prominent.PNG)

That is prominent enough for me. Looks like the frontend sends the backend both the challenge and the challenge answer. I can just set both to whatever I want. 

The challenge looks like an MD5 hash. I made up my own challenge answer, generated the hash of it, and then sent both.

Login successful.

# Looking For Greener Grass

Well. Turns out our friend Brian Oliver kind of sucks. Loading all the statements from all the months and years that the UI provides (and the additional months and years that the backend supports but the UI doesn't show) turns up nothing. 

Looking around a bit, I was curious if I could gather any information from the cookie. The cookie was set to:
`eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiRjhnSGlxU2RwSyIsImhhc2giOiJkZTIzNWJmZmQyM2RmNjk5NWFkNGUwOTMwYmFhYzFhMiJ9`. 

Decoding the base 64 string returns: `{"account_id":"F8gHiqSdpK","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}`.

I also noticed that every time I clicked to `Load Transactions`, it would fire off a request like:
`https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/accounts/F8gHiqSdpK/statements?month=01&year=2020`. 

It is interesting that the account id of my cookie also appears in this URL. From experimenting, editing the cookie to change the account id also changes the API request. We could potentially use an account id here that triggers a different endpoint.

## Investigating Possibilities of the API Domain
To exploit the api, we need to understand api. Going to `api.bountypay.h1ctf.com` shows:

![img](images/api.PNG)

The link is a cheeky redirect to google search what a rest api is. https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/redirect?url=https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+API. Cheeky as it may be, this is an open redirect that we could make use of to perform a SSRF.

## Finding Our Target
From exploring earlier, the software domain looks like a likely target. It was rudely refusing access altogether due to our IP. 

![img](images/software.PNG)

## Performing the Attack
It is time to do some SSRF.

I set the cookie to the base 64 encoded version of `{"account_id":"../../../redirect?url=https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/&disregard=","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}`

The `../` characters navigate us to the base api endpoint in order to use the `/redirect` path. 

I had to use the `&disregard=` at the end in order to make the browser **not** interpret the rest of the imposed url (`/statements?month=01&year=2020"`) to mean "use the `/statements` endpoint".

With this request we are able to connect to the `software` domain and see...another login page. Better than the IP block error from before though, I'll take it.

## TODO: ADD IMAGE

# These Are the Droids You Are Looking For
Using our good buddy `ffuf` again, I scanned to see what directories are available on the `software` domain without being logged in.

```
{"account_id":"../../../redirect?url=https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/FUZZ&disregard=","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}`
```

It turned up a folder, `uploads`. This page was a directory listing containing a file `BountyPay.apk`. Navigating my browser to https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/uploads/BountyPay.apk downloaded the application.
